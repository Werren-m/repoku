Happily ensconced in their Addams way of life for years, Gomez and Morticia prepare for a visit from their extended family for Pugsley’s “Sabre Mazurka,” a rite of passage ceremony to prove he is ready to become an Addams Family man. Little does the family know, their neighbor down the hill is constructing a prefabricated community, replete with technicolor pop and perfectionism. When the fog lifts, Margaux is disconcerted to see The Addams Family mansion—the one thing standing between her dream of selling all the houses in the neighborhood and being adored as a TV personality forever. As Pugsley struggles to learn the complicated “Sabre Mazurka” routine, Wednesday finds herself struggling with coming-of-age. She befriends Margaux’s daughter Parker and pushes boundaries, as well as, Morticia’s buttons by joining in on “normal” pursuits like attending public school, cheerleading, and pink barrettes.",
